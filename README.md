<h1>PokeApp 3.0</h1>
<hr><p>Expanded Pokedex app</p><h2>General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>PokeApp 3.0 is a Pokedex app serving data from PokeAPI created with React, Tailwind,</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>It's a practice project meant to serve widely-available information in an interesting, consistent way.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Learning and practicing usage of HTML, React, Tailwind, React-Query. Big challenges included fetching large amounts of data in an efficient way, handling deeply-nested and filled with reference urls responses from PokeAPI, debugging issues coming from React, third-party libraries and those specific to environment (iOS).</li>
</ul><h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>React</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>React-query</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Auth0</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Vite</li>
</ul><h2>Features</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>Fetching and caching data with react-query</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Cool gradient backgrounds for Pokemon (colored based on types!)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Ability to authenticate with Google using Auth0 and change profile picture to select custom images &amp; backgrounds. This functionality is a mock-up in a sense that there is no backend, no accounts are created, users are not kept track of at all.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Ability to mark Pokemon as caught, check that list and type distribution visualised with a pie-chart. Normally this functionality would be available for users who log in only, but as I have no backend here to store data for users it's available publicly and persisted only via local storage.</li>
